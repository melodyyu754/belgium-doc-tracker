# Phase 1 Updates

## Data

Phase II team blog post sections contâ€™d:
Provide reasoning for Data Viz choices and interpret results in context of big questions of interest
Include information about preliminary implementation of ML model (e.g. difficulties, tasks remaining, etc.)

The model we focused on was the relationship between GDP per capita and protests per capita. We first accessed the complete database
of protests via the ACLED api, joining it with Global Bank Data (population and GDP per capita). We initially started with just a couple of European
countries, but realized that we needed a wider range of countries and GDP per capitas. We included democratic countries from five continents (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia).

### Worldwide GDP per Capita vs. Protests per Capita

Upon looking at the worldwide graph, we added columns for each area (Western, Asia, South America), and plotted per area as well.

### Western GDP per Capita vs. Protests per Capita

### South America GDP per Capita vs. Protests per Capita

### Asia GDP per Capita vs. Protests per Capita

### Poverty gap at $2.15 a day vs. Events per Capita

### Public Trust of the Government vs GDP per Capita vs Events per Capita

We decided to fit a linear regression model to our data (for the time being).

With this relationship it shows that when public trust and gdp per capita are 0, the number of protest events per capita is 4.7. When you increase public trust by 1 unit, it decreases the number of protests by 0.9%. When you increase public trust by 1 unit it increases the gdp per capita by 0.002%. There seems to be a slight positive relationship between public trust and the number of protests but not much of a relationship between public trust and gdp per capita. If we add more related features to our model, perhaps this relationship would be stronger as well as making our model more complex. Since these values do not show a strong relationship perhaps we will use a more complex model or try and fit a quadratic line to better model our data for future phases.
