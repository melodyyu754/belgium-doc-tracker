# Introduction

Hi, our names are Melody, Sierra, Sonia, and Maggie!

## Informative Context

Europe and North America have witnessed a surge in political protests in recent years, with diverse groups expressing their grievances on various issues. We’ve seen recent demonstrations on US college campuses regarding Israel vs. Palenstine and have also witnessed them occurring in major European cities such as Amsterdam and Leuven. The US especially is no stranger to protesting with the Black Lives Matter, 2nd Amendment Rights and Roe v. Wade in recent years.

**Our application seeks to do _two_ main things:**

1. Provide a space for protest organizers and activists to connect, share about their experiences and protests, and learn about their issue of choice at a larger scale (both nationally and internationally). There will be a curated feed of news, protests, and policy developments tailored to the activist's selected areas of interest.
2. Examine correlations between socioeconomic factors and political protest levels using machine learning models. This will help politicians/policymakers and journalists, in addition to activists, understand what fuels protests and also if the same trend occurs in other democratic countries.

## Where are we getting our data from?

Our application will focus on major democratic countries, initially targeting the US and EU, with a goal of expanding to other regions in the future. By analyzing data from ACLED, the World Bank, and other APIs, we will employ machine learning models to uncover patterns, predict future trends, and cluster countries based on their unique protest landscapes.

# Questions We Want To Address

1. What kind of space can be created for activists across the world to come together and organize protests for political change?
   > **Importance:** There can be a disconnect between different organizers in different regions/countries, so this platform would be a centralized space where activists can connect and learn from one another, as well as garner support for the causes they are passionate about.
2. How do a country’s major socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, ​​poverty level) affect the likelihood/rate of political protests in NATO countries?
   > **Importance:** Understanding the relationships between socioeconomic factors and political protests in NATO is important for understanding the causes of political instability. Additionally, we want to see the differences between varying countries and how these factors play a role. If we know that income inequality is a strong predictor of labor protests, for instance, policymakers can prioritize measures to address economic disparities.
3. How does governmental trust impact the number of political protests? How does governmental trust impact the amount of violent political protests?
   > **Importance:** Politicians may want to know what the correlation is between their leadership and the political unrest in their area.
