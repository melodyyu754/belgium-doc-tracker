## NATO and EEAS's Role in Tackling Misinformation 
On this dialogue, we have had the opportunity to go visit EEAS and NATO headquarters which were both very interesting and informative. The European External Action Service (EEAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organiation (NATO) both play a role in facilitating conversation and compromise within the Euoropean Union and the countries a part of NATO that can hold different beliefs, different government structures, and different interests. 

At NATO and EEAS the subject of misinformation was discussed and both organizations talked about what they are currently trying to do to combat it and how it can be mitigated going forward. I was very intrigued by this becuase I did not know that prestigious organizations were interested in preventing this issue. This made me realize how harmful misinformation is and has become on a mass level. The speakers talked a lot about misinformation in Russia and the type of content and messages they promote to try and persuade public opinion which was quite alarming to hear. The fact that governments, who the people are supposed to trust, can spew misinformation is quite frightening. The EEAS current approach to tackling misinformation is looking at the foundational weakspots specifically in social media platforms that can allow for misinformation to reach a large amount of people. This sounds like a good approach but I am curious to see where the line will be drawn at changing the policies of social media platforms without compromising freedom of speech and if the United States approach to handling misinformation will differ due to this concern. 

When someone brought the question of freedom of speech up to one of the speakers, the speaker pointed out that the freedom of speech laws are more restricted in Belgium than the United States so americans would be more inclined to take this into concern than europeans which I thought was an interesting and true cultural difference in the way we respond to any type of law that could potentially restrict our ability to speak freely, even if it is for the greater good.
