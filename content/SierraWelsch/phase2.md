# My Contributions 
The second week felt like it went by more quickly than the first week. While the first week was more relaxed and I spent most of my time getting to know the other people on the dialogue, the second week is where I felt our course work start to pick up which I was glad about because I was able to start applying the concepts I learned in ds3000 to our project. In addition, we went to Brussels many times which was nice. I enjoyed our time there especially at the Atomium. I really enjoyed the light show. I was not able to go to Antwerp this week because I was sick, but I wish I could have gone. It has been interesting to compare and contrast the architecture in each of the city we have been to. I like trying to identify the older more historical buildings from the newer ones. I personally perfer Leuven's architecture to Brussels because it is mostly older, so I am glad we are staying in Leuven. It has been nice getting familiar with this town and knowing my way around like I am a local. 

For this Phase of the project I worked on webscraping and cleaning the government trust dataset from OCED using selenium and transforming the original data to have an observation per country. To clean the data I replaced the null values with the mean of the values that were within the same column of the null value, and working on creating data visualizations with our merged datasets. I also worked with our group to envison what our app screens would look like as well as what type of plots we wanted to come up with.

When trying to complete our phase 2, we ran into a few issues with trying to differentiate some of our user personas from one another and trying to find more clear trends within the data we were working with. It was challenging and worried me that our project idea might have not been the best but both professers assured us that struggling is a good thing which proved to be true as we eventually were able to complete our ER diagram and find specific features that seemed to have a more clear relationship.
