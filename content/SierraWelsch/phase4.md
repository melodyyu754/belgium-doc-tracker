## Phase 4: Final Stretch of the Dialogue
I can't believe this dialogue is almost over. In this past week, I have learned so much about integrating api routes, training a machine learning model, and how to deal, or try to deal, with merge conflicts. I have also really enjoyed working with streamlit. As someone who hates working on frontend work, streamlit was so easy to use and had a lot of cool widgets and attributes to play around with. I think the UI looks much cleaner than AppSmith and it offered a lot of functionality. 

Training our linear regression model was hard, especially when trying to increase the accuracy of the model without violating key assumptions made by the model and/or overfitting. I had to make a lot of decisions to train the most optimal model by looking at the residual plots but ultimately think we produced a pretty decent model considering we are predicting the number of protests. I will be doing a Data Science Internship this summer so I am excited to apply the skills I have learning from this project. 

I also created the 'view articles' page and button which I really enjoyed as I got to refresh my database design skills of querying from the database.

In conclusion, I really enjoyed working on this project and collaborating with my peers. I think we all made something we are proud of and think it was a great way to end this dialogue.

### Resume
Rallify (MySQL, Python, Flask, Streamlit)
- Developed a fullstack, data-driven, containerized web application empowering and amplifying political protests around the world
- Implemented key features enabling listing and filtering through news articles and building a linear regression model to predict number of protests in a country
