# Hallo!😁

My name is Sierra Welsch. I am currently a second year student at Northeastern University pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am interested in machine learning/artificial intelligence and how it can be used in ways that improve our society, specifically marginalized/underrepresented groups. I also enjoy learning about the role technology can play in benefiting our planet and wildlife.
