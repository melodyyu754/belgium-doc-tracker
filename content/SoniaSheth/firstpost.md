# Culture & Cybersecurity
I arrived in Belgium on May 13th around 6am (super early, I know) and waiting in the airport for 5-6 hours as the rest of the group slowly started to arrive. 
Upon our arrival in Leuven, we were immediately immersed into the culture of the area. I enjoy learning about new cultures and ways of life, so it has been amazing being able to live a new life here so far as a local. 

I enjoyed our walking tour where we learned about the city of Leuven. While I’m certainly used to it now, I was surprised to learn that the main mode of transportation is bikes rather than cars. I’ve learned to consistently look behind me and be aware of bikers behind me, they honestly can be quite scary. Diving deeper in the culture, it differs quite a bit to what we are used to in the United States. A huge part of being a student in Leuven is as the tour guide said, “sports and beer”. Leuven is known for their beer, and it’s crazy how the beer is cheaper than water. Being charged for water in general is insane! The nightlife here is also very popular. Both older adults and students tend to go out every day of the week, way late in the evenings simply to socialize and hang out. This means that the city ‘sleeps late’, unlike Boston where everything closes at 9pm. 

I’ve also been quite surprised by the culturally diversity in Leuven. I’m a huge foodie and there are so many different types of cuisines present in the city. I’ve loved trying new types of food for lunch and dinner every day, one of my favorites being Pain Leuven, a sandwich shop with such fresh ingredients. Of course, I also had to try a waffle! I had my first Belgium waffle in Brussels after our EEAS visit, and omg it was so delicious. 

Switching gears a bit to the government/political aspect of the dialogue so far, we had the opportunity to visit the EEAS and NATO. First off, I didn’t know that Brussels is the headquarters for a lot of the major parts of the European Government, such as NATO and the European government. As I’ve learned more about the EU and how all the countries all work together/create policy, I feel so lucky and fortunate to be part of this experience where I get to visit these super important institutions. At the EEAS and NATO, I was particularly fascinated about the talks on misinformation and cybersecurity. I didn’t realize that some new articles on the web / posts could be completely faked by other countries, like Russia, and how important it is to be aware of threats like that on the internet. It made me really think about if we can even really trust anything we read online or can we trust any news source at all? These are subtle hybrid attacks in which NATO/countries continuously have to be aware of and protect themselves against. These chats at the EEAS and NATO have piqued my interest in cybersecurity and made me realize that it might actually be a field I want to work in someday. 

# Aside: My Contribution
I helped brainstorm topic ideas and once a topic idea was chosen, brainstorm the questions we wanted to answer, data we might want to look at, and the specific personas we want to target. Then, I worked on writing the personas + user story descriptions.
