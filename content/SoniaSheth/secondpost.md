## Week II in Beligum 
    Week II in Belgium has been tiring, but very fun and rewarding. It has been nice growing closer with my peers along with building a small little life here. It feels less like a vacation and more like a home (for now). 
    
    On Wednesday, we had the opportunity to visit the European Parliament and European Commission. I thought that this was an amazing experience and opportunity. I mean who can say that they visited those important government buildings? Yah…actually probably quite a few people but I feel special knowing I got to be there. I learned from a previous speaker that the parliament is where legislation is passed, and the commission/council is where policy/laws are made. We also watched an impactful video at the Parliament about the power of exercising democracy and using your vote. It quite honestly made me tear up. After watching that, it made me realize that my vote matters and I should always use my right to vote. I will be registering to vote finally when I get back home; I’m kind of embarrassed that I haven’t yet.
    
    The next day we visited another European Cybersecurity Organization. One take away I got from this chat was the idea of embedded security. I didn’t know that this research / field existed, and I found it super interesting. It is something that I would like to look more into, and possibly get more involved with at Northeastern!
    
    Finally, I simply been enjoying further exploring Leuven. The other day I found the Newbury of Leuven about 15 minutes from ICL; there are so many shops, thrifting, and food! I can’t believe I missed it this whole time. It’s a beautiful to walk through that street and pop in and out of stores. I’m hoping that next week I’ll have some time to further explore that area and eat!
    
## Phase II Contribution 
    For this Phase of the project I worked on making our local + global ER diagrams. I spent quite a long time flushing this out. On Saturday, I began working on the ER Diagram, however was under the assumption that each persona would be an entity. I soon learned after 3 hours of work that I had approached the ER diagrams slightly the wrong way that that instead, all our personas will actually just lump into users. After this, I lead reworking our user stories a little bit so that the journalists and activists differ more. Furthermore, I flushed out exactly what features we want our app to achieve, and from here was able to move to local/global ER diagrams. Using thoses diagrams, I wrote our SQL DDL tables and tried my best to get the M:M / 1:M relationships correct.
