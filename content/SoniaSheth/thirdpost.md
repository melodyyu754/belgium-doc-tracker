# Week III in Beligum / Luxembourg 
The highlight of this past week most definitely was our weekend in Luxembourg - my birthday weekend! I really enjoyed the walking tour of Luxembourg and learning about the history of the city. I assumed that Luxembourg was always a rich country, however, in the 1800s they were actually quite poor. It was the rise of the banks that brought back their wealth. I am also very interested in art history and architecture so it was amazing to walk into the church in the city center where we learned that two sides of the church were constructing at different times. I could totally see the style and architecture differences. We also saw a LIVE confession happening in the corner of the church, but we were allowed in that area for obvious reasons. 

Later in the day, I went with a group to go hiking! We went about an hour south and went on a hike that passed through Germany and France. So, technically, I can say that I celebrated my birthday in 3 different countries. I absolutely loved being out and nature and being able to see so many different landscapes; it was so peaceful. When we crossed into France, there was a praire field that we walked through - straight out of Wizard of Oz. I actually had never seen anything like that before. I climbed the watch tower and all was in sight were miles and miles of wheat....

Immediately after hiking, we caught a bus back and trammed to the hotel, where I quickly got ready for dinner. Sydney and I celebrated our birthday at an Italian restaurant along with others in the dialogue - so much fun and really yummmmmmmy food!

I am 21! I walked 30,000 steps! What a day! 
    
# Phase II Contribution 
For this Phase of the project, the first thing I worked on was mocking up all our mock data in mockeroo. I worked on finalizing our CREATE tables and incorported any feedback into out ER diagrams. This included adding some attributes and also changing the primary key for country. After mocking up the data, I had to convert the jsons to insert statements, which I achieved by created a Python script. Following this, I ran our tables and insert statements in DataGrip. This process took some time because it caught all my errors I made with data types when originally mocking up the data. After getting it all to pass/run, I added our tables and SQL insert statements to our project.
Once creating the mock data, I worked on creating the GET and POST routes for our protests blueprints. When fleshing out the POST route, I ran into quite a few issues, starting with connection issues with the web-api and then formatting the SQL insert statement correctly.
