# Week IV in Beligum
The highlight of this past week was attending the Belgium vs. Luxembourg soccer game. I had never been to a soccer game before, not to mention a European soccer game! I learned a lot about the importance of soccer to european culture in my Spanish class in high school. I never really understand why soccer was such a religion to europeans until this week. The whole stadium united in chanting for Belgium and everyone was decked out in Belgium swag. After the game, the streets were filled with food vendors, people chanting some more, policeman on horses, and just so much excitment and joy. American football could never! I really enjoyed being in that environment and it is something I will never forget. 
    
# Phase IV Contribution 
For this phase of the project I took charge of the update / delete button functionality for both posts and protests. This included writing the routes necessary for implementation and updating the pages being switched to. I also worked on some front end appearances.

The part of this project I found the most challenging was communciation with development between the team. At times, some developers were working on the same files, changing different functionality, leading to so many merge conflicts. I also found it difficult to manage and navigate through all the different routes and pages, since many things were similar and differed only by a couple characters. It was a large project with many moving parts and it got hard to organize in my head at times. 

That being said, I absolutely loved connecting the all the parts together: API, backend and frontend. I liked learning to build routes and I feel like this is the last little piece of basic CS knowledge I needed to learn to be successful as a software engineer in the real world.
