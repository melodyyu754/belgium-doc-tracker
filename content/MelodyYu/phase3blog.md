## Phase 3: Experiences

### Reflections on the dialogue

During this week of the dialogue, I felt more comfortable with the structure and pace of life. Since the DS3000 lectures were over, I was able to spend more time investing in both the project and also exploring with friends.

I really enjoyed Luxembourg - it was by far my favorite part of the dialogue so far. One of the biggest (though kind of unfortunate) things that I've learned on this dialogue is that I very much prefer more laid-back mountainous areas to cities. I hiked both full days we were in Luxembourg, racking up over 80,000 steps over the course of the two days. I was also able to get to know some of my classmates while hiking that I hadn't yet been able to spend much time with.

I also enjoyed the guest lectures this week - specifically the lectures we had about data ethics and privacy. I sometimes read about tech ethics philosophy, and it was cool to learn about the dynamics between innovation and regulation. I enjoyed hearing about the GDPR and its importance and how big companies often violate it, and then also hearing about concerns overregulation from the corporation side. Health House, although not particularly accurate, was also thought provoking and made me think about the possibilities of technology (and the necessity of regulating it).

### Phase 2 contributions and tribulations

During this phase of the project, I worked on planning out the pages of our streamlit application. I made the design decision to change our file system from user-based filing (i.e. starting pages used by Activist by one number) to feature-based filing (starting pages relating to protests by one number). I also worked on the Machine Learning aspect of the project and helped refine our model predicting events per capita, as well as started working on our model that uses k-means clustering to cluster countries in our database.

Finally, I cleaned and prepared the 'country' dataset (real data) that is to be combined and integrated into our database with mock data.
