## Phase 2: My Contributions

The second/third week of the dialogue passed much quicker than the first. There was much more of a routine of classes and homework, and I was also able to get out into Belgium a bit more. I explored Ghent and Bruges on my own, and also met a group of KU Leuven students and got to talk with them about their experiences here. It was crazy to learn that their tuition is so cheap (~1000 Euro per semester). I had trouble really liking Belgium during the first week of the dialogue (it seemed too similar to Boston), but I've found that it has a certain kind of charm evident in all the different cities. One of my favorite parts of Belgium has been the beguinages - it's been fun learning about the history, and I've now visited beguinages in Leuven, Mechelen, Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp.

During this phase of the project, our group worked collaboratively to think about what our app should look like. Outside of data model development, I worked on cleaning the ACLED data and accessing the World Bank Data API, then created plots that compared GDP per capita with Protests per Capita.

This was definitely challenging, as a lot of my data science knowledge wasn't great (I hadn't finished the homework yet), and it was difficult to think about how the user personas would be integrated in the application.
