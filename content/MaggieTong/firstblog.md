# First Blog - Week 1!
We’ve had many great outings and speakers in Belgium the first few days of the dialogue! To name a few, we had an Orientation Walk of Leuven on the first day, visited the European External Action Service in the European Union, NATO and the Computer Museum NAM-IP. I really appreciated getting a historical and cultural background on Leuven from a local and was especially interested in the female community, the Groot Begijnhof. Additionally, I enjoyed playing around with the old technology at the Computer Museum and seeing how new technologies influenced the modern computer today. However, overall my favorite experience has been visiting the NATO headquarters and getting to speak with members of the Innovation Hybrid and Cyber Division.

## NATO 
It was great to get an overview of the purpose of NATO and its goal in the international arena with the first speaker. Beginning with learning about the different ages of NATO, from the first post WW2 age to the current age in dealing with Russian conflict, climate change and emerging technologies, I got a better sense of NATO’s deterrence and defense tactics. 

From the second speaker, I gained a lot of perspective on the impacts of misinformation and the goal to soften a population. It really opened my eyes to the fact that social media companies really need to be doing more in terms of regulating privacy and keeping individuals safe from these hybrid wars.

The third speaker was the most interesting to me in terms of learning about NATO’s relationship with the technological private sector companies. Within all the conversations, private sector companies like Microsoft and Google have been mentioned as providing technological services to the public sector since all the technological advancements are within the private sector in today’s age. The third conversation, which was mainly surrounding how NATO works to encourage innovation, instilled the necessity of maintaining the alliance’s technological edge to implement NATO’s deterrence and defense ideologies. It was really interesting to learn about Diana and NATO’s Innovation Fund, which invests in start up agile companies to push the development of commercial products that can have military applications. It was particularly interesting to me to learn about these types of companies because I hope to work at a startup post grad that provides a flexible product for multiple applications.

## Aside: Contributions
My contributions to the first phase of the project included coming up with ideas and flushing out the feasibility of various topics. Additionally, I worked on writing up the user personas and user stories.
