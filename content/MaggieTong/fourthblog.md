## Week 4!
I've very sad to be leaving Leuven. It's been great form friendships with everyone here while getting to go on great excursions and work on a collaborative project. I'm grateful to have had Melody, Sonia and Sierra as my group members and throughly enjoyed working with them. The highlights of the last week included going to Genk, hearing the talk from the lawyer about companies tracking personal data and the entertainment from health house. I really enjoyed the final talks from the speakers in Genk! The material of the talks reminded me of my engineering classes. 


## Contributions
My contributions in the final phase of the project included creating the filtering for posts, protests and the protest maps. I also created the interactive protest map that allowed users to get protest information after clicking on a point. My final contribution was creating and resolving merge conflicts.
