## Week 2!
The highlights of the second week were visiting the Microsoft office, seeing the Atomium and making pastries! The Microsoft office was very cool, especially the coffee machine which was all controlled through an ipad (ironic). In the talks, we learned about the Microsoft ecosystem, additional aspect of AI and the rapid growth of data. I was particularly interested in the data growth statistics as it also means there’s a growing need for data centers, a lot of which are being built in my hometown, Northern Virginia. These data centers could be a big environmental problem if there are no renewable energy initiatives. I’m curious to see if big companies, like Microsoft, will be able to mitigate the environmental impact of data growth and adhere to their sustainability initiatives.

The Atomium and the area surrounding it was also really interesting! The light show within the center ball was so captivating I felt like I could have sat there for hours. Exploring the Atomium was the most fun event of the trip until we got to go make the pastries through. It was great to do something physically and creatively engaging. Overall, I’ve really enjoyed the events in the past week and also the big dinners with everyone as well. 


## Contributions
My contributions to the second phase of the project included creating the wireframes for the user personas and working with the team to flush out the ER Diagram concepts. When working to figure out what aspects of phase 1 we wanted to work off of, it was difficult to figure out how we wanted the application to flow with the data we’re pulling in and how to separate each user persona distinctly. I think we have a pretty good idea of how our project fits into the application setting but we are still trying to figure out how specifically we will be integrating our data and what attributes we specifically need to do so.
