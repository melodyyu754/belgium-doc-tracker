## Week 3!
The highlights of the third week going to Antwerp and visiting Luxembourg! While I didn't particularily enjoy the city layout as much as Leuven's, the hills were beautiful and the nature surrounding the city was great. Also the free transportation made it possible to get to the end of the city in just an hour and one bus. Another big highlight of luxembourg was getting to see my parents! They are on a Europe trip and we got to crossover! 


## Contributions
My contributions to the third phase of the project included working with sonia to create get, post, put and delete routes for the posts and protests features. I initially began with working on the get, put and delete routes to render the data, update features and remove based on id for posts. I then implemented the same features for protests and implemented post in posts based on Sonia's implementation in protest. Figuring out the payload creation for updating and using the id to delete were the unique portions of the routes. The most difficult part was getting accustom to the environment and learning how to work with docker.
